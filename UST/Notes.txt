MultiThreading

Thread -smallest unit of process
Java is Multi Threaded,JavaScript is Single Threaded
Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() - Available no of processors
MultiProcessing - Different Processes running together

Life Cycle of Thread

New >>>>>>>>Runnable(When you call start method) means  you are scheduling the Thread
Runnable to running and vice versa depending on your scheduler
Runnable can go to blocked state if it needs to wait for a resource
(sleep(),wait(),notify(),sleep completes)
Once code in runnable is complete,it goes to dead state
yield() - gives chance to another thread to execute


Difference between sleep and wait 
...Sleep is applied on threads
....wait is applied on objects
